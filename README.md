# Neo4j – Graph DB

1.  What is Graph DB
    - They’re not visual graph and charts. 
    - Graph databases use nodes to store data entities, and edges to store relationships between entities
    - Data is represented as nodes, which are connected by edges, or relationships. 
    - Each node and edge can also have properties, which store additional information about the data. 
    - The graph model is a natural fit for data with complex relationships, such as social networks, supply chains, and biological networks.

2. How it differs from Relational DB model
   - A relational database is based on the relational model, which stores data in tables with rows and columns. 
   - In a relational database, relationships between data are typically represented using foreign keys and join operations. 
   - RDBMs are very good at handling structured data with a fixed schema, they can become slow and complex when dealing with highly interconnected data.
